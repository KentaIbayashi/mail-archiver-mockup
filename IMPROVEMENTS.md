1. Add Keyword Filter:
This system only has date filter to inspect emails. Considering the actual use case of security incidents, it should have a keyword filter in order to search suspected keywords. So I would add a keyword filter next to the date filter.(below the date filter in the mobile layout)

2. Implement Favorite Button:
Favorite button column should be implemented in the table. In the system in the provided design, even if you find suspected emails which could cause security incidents, there is no way to keep them. In order to recheck them quickly, I would implement a favorite column right to the date column.(right to the subject text in the mobile layout) 

3. Colorize UI Parts:
Icons, emphasized texts and a grayed background are better to be colorized. Since all UI parts other than mouse hover texts designed in monochrome, it's quite hard to recognize important section in the whole screen. So I would add a theme color in the UI parts.
