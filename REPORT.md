 Making responsive design was pretty hard work. At the beginning I researched UI library  which can satisfy the specifications of the email table, and I picked up bootstrap-vue and element-ui, but I realized the code with UI library could be more complicated than doing from scratch because the DOM structures between desktop and mobile layouts are not the same. After trial and error, I ended up to coding the table without using UI library.
 Implementing the switching logic from desktop to mobile layout was also tricky. As I mentioned, only using responsive framework like boot-strap is not enough to construct DOM in two defferent layouts. Then I wrote the two templates which can switch with the current screen size, and the default threshold is set to 800px. I made sure that the layout of the final mockup won't be broken with any screen size.
